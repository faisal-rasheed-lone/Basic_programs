# Hello Dear Viewer 
- This directory contains the programs which i have done as part of academics, these may include files/programs ranging from basic to intermediate level.
- Also you may find various files empty/ not running properly, its because i did not cross check at the time of pushing the directory.
- So, if you find any useful  program take that, and if any file requires attention do a request, will update that file in collaboration.
- As i said these progs were the part of curriculum so this directory may contain the files in a mingled form like jav/cpp/c etc , so ignore that also.
- Happy Journey
